Watch out! If you wander

Those enemy Bob-ombs love
to fight, and they're

attack.
This meadow has become
a battlefield ever since
the Big Bob-omb got his
paws on the Power Star.
Can you recover the Star
for us? Cross the bridge

Thank you, Mario! The Big

You have to master three
important jumping
techniques.
First try the Triple Jump.

If you time the jumps
right, you'll hop, skip,
then jump really high.
Next, go for distance

to jump really far.

To do the Wall Kick, press
